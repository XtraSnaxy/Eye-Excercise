# Eye-Excercise


# Description
This project features two eyes, created through CSS and HTML, that track the mouse cursor across the screen. This is done via a JavaScript program that tracks the current location of the cursor while changing the X and Y axis of the eye balls. 

# How To Run
On the "Projects" page, simply click the "Eye Exercise" link and the program will immediately start running.

# Future Improvements
My future plans for this project are more detailed CSS for the eyes and face.
